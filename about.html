       <p>Cobblecade was created by my friends and I for fun, just so we can do something on the side, because we do nothing all day long...</p>
       <p>We like playing minigames and we connect a lot when we play minecraft so we thought it was a good idea to open a server up so that others can experience the fun that we get from playing these minigames!</p>
       <h6>We needed a family-friendly name so we stuck with Cobblecade over other options...</h6>

      <h2>Bi-Weekly Updates!</h2>
    </section>
    <p>That's right!</p>
    <p>You can expect an update to drop on Cobblecade, every other week so that you always have something to do!</p>
    <p>The Server is always up! 24/7!</p>
